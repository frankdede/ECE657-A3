              "array([\"Just kidding, I rented 12 Monkeys the other day because I am a huge Bruce Willis fan and I heard some things about the film. Some good and some bad, but it was one of those films you had to pay attention to every second, so I was a bit worried. Just because I felt like for a minute if this was going to be one of those films that I had to watch several times to get. But I watched it last night and I was really impressed, this movie had everything in it: action, drama, sci-fi, history, dark humor, and even a little romance. The actors all did a terrific job, I give a lot of credit to Bruce, during his scene in the car with his psychiatrist, he really got to me. But Brad Pitt, I'm just amazed with how much of a great job he did. He didn't over do his character, who was crazy, and just made it work and was extremely believable. The story was just scary, but very good and a wake up call.<br /><br />James Cole is a man in the future where a virus broke out in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1% of the population survived including him. Animals are now ruling the ground above while the humans are down below, but scientists send James to the past of 1990(really meaning to send him to '96), to find out about information of the virus. James gets put into a mental institution meeting his new psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Raily and another mental patient, Jeffrey Goines. He tells them the future, of course no one believes him, he goes back to the future. But the scientists send him back to the correct year to where the doctor is kidnapped by James, but he tells her more, and believes him. Now they are set on trying to prevent the virus from ever happening.<br /><br />12 Monkeys was an incredible film. Like I said the story was so scary just because it's not at all hard to believe that we are not far from that happening. But the whole movie was just great, the cast, the sets, just the whole picture was a great one. It had a Terminator type of feel to it where we might loose something precious one day, ourselves if we don't listen to others. What is right and what is wrong? Who knows? But I would highly recommend 12 Monkeys, it's a great movie that if you give it the proper chance, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />9/10\",\n",
              "       'I was pretty young when this came out in the US, but I recorded it from TV and watched it over and over again until I had the whole thing memorized. To this day I still catch myself quoting it. The show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters, from Frank Sinatra, to Sylvester Stallone, to Mr. T. The voices were great, and sounded just like the characters they were portraying. The puppets were also well done, although a little creepy. I was surprised to find out just recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf, a show that I also enjoy very much. Like another person had written in a comment earlier, I too was robbed of this great show by a \"friend\" who borrowed it and never returned it. I sure wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a DVD release, but I don\\'t think enough people have heard of it. Oh well, maybe I\\'ll try e-bay...',\n",

Should (but won\\'t) be seen by all cinephiles, and the DVD from Criterion is exactly as good as you\\'d expect.

The show\\'s hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to Cassie\\'s character.<br /><br />The overall staging is very self-conscious.<br /><br />The only reason I give it a 2, is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the film\\'s attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it.',\n",

She escapes, heads to B&B and instead of hubby going ballistic and she wanting to call the cops, story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both their parts. Wow.<br /><br />Other action logic deficits abound. Acting is also lukewarm, and the next door neighbor's warning is delivered in a really corny, badly acted moment.<br /><br />Moments of intense gore/death unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of time-filler interplay between characters.<br /><br />Less focus on gore, more focus on mood and story would have been appreciated.\",\n",

If you like to see good acting and an excellent screenplay, do not go see this movie. If you like typical hollywood war films that end just in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Otherwise, don't waste your time. I am always interested in war movies because I think that if they are done well, they can TEACH us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war. This film shows a bunch of guys running around the countryside, saying whorrible cliche lines, doing the most predictable things, and defending the oppressed with the same exact force and brutality that was being given to the oppressed. This film is a disgrace to filmmaking and to the United States of America! Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa, or any other country and watching this, being told that this is how Americans truly are? No wonder everyone hates us!

            "an intriguingly bold film weaves the seemingly effortless camerawork with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack to plot the damaging effects of the crime and corruption of the santiago underworld on 2 naive young brothers from the southern city of temucofilm debutant daniella rios is the seductive erotic dancer gracia working in the nightclub owned by the face of the new miniwave in chilean film production alejandro trejo the elder brother played maturely by nestor cantillana is easily convinced to become trejos lead henchman after a night at the stripclub to celebrate younger brother victors juan pablo miranda seventeenth birthday from the establishing shot of this opening scene the film explodes into neonoir exploration of everything the outside world doesnt usually expect to see in this country so stereotypically conservative and catholicgracias charms of seduction attract the three men like bees to honey although the circular narrative of the threeway fantasy romance revolves around the linear portrayal of major international drug deals between trejos men and the gringo eduardo barril power relations become a vital theme as societys outsiders merge in a minifamily the prostitute holds an exotic spell over all the chilean men in the film emerging from her ambiguous position in the periphery of society and is seen as holding the key to all three mens futures the relationships between trejo and cantillana become important as the boys parents are conspicious by their absence one assumes they still live in temuco therefore it is trejo el padrino who adopts cantillana and effectively makes him as a man in the city miranda rapidly becomes the desperate outsider as his dependency on his father figure cantillana becomes increasingly strained by jealousy over the beautiful gracia however miranda remains trapped by the constraint of still being in school  he is dependent on cantillana who is dependent on trejo for the money to survive trejo in turn is under the thumb of the gringo and his wealth has been accumulated through drug deals and well as his strip clubs the figure of gracia acts as a time bomb viewed as a beautiful firework she wraps a web of beauty inside the patriarchy but the strain can only lead to one climaxas the tensions of these power relations come to head gracia remains ambiguously elusive the viewer is never sure which male figure she will commit to the film concludes tragically and explosively in a shoot out which realigns power relations and erases half the major male protanganists the final shot of mirandas beaten face speeding down the panamericano highway is despairingly powerful the boy has been sucked in by the lure of the citys underworld yet has lost his only visible family and his woman who is his only friend in the film he has nothing the overriding metaphors are bold and brave this is a gangster film in chile the notions of family no sex before marriage etc are abolished and instead the harsh realities of the other side of santiagos coin are displayed in all their savage glory trejo beats rios brutally rios and miranda make love in a cinema reel room  a whore having sex with a minor she barely knows the gringos are seen to have a financial hold over this small latin american nation but not through the copper mines through the illegal path of drugswaissbluths triumph is in his presentation of this dark underworld which raises so many social questions more perhaps than the recordbreakingly successful sexo con amor within a slick smooth firecracker of a film which place this film firmly alongside sexo con amor taxi para tres and el chacotero sentimental as cinematic evidence that chile is well and truly artistically alive and kicking in the posttransition period 15 years after the censorship of the military regime\n",
            "according to this board i guess either you love it or hate it usually how it goes with all movies there is no need to get testy with others though all we are doing here is giving opinions i rented this movie last night and i want to come and throw my opinion in the mix i was surprised by how many people are thrashing it though theres a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan im a horror movie fan most plain olé movie fans dont like horror movies so many low budget cam corder looking movies are coming out these days its hard to keep up and what makes it tough to stay into these movies is how bad they are i wanted to come and write a review about hood of the living dead because its pretty damn good compared to the rest of the junk out there its nothing special but its those horror film makers that try to be too serious that end up making a horrible horror film i really liked this one you telling me there is no effort in this one and one more thing i bet all of you have all of these huge dvd collections that you are so proud of nothing but major motion pictures right nothing wrong with that but you have to know how to appreciate lowbudget independent i knew what i was getting when i watched this movie im not going to be upset because i thought it was going to be some 100 million dollar movie some of you might need to stick with watching the matrix over and over again and stop trying to compare everything to the matrix and if most of you are under 24 that explains everything good movie folks check it out\n"
